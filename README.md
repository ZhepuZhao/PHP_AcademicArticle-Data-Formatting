## This project mainly implements following functions:

1. Add sort function so that user could sort based on different kinds of data of an article like title, author, year
2. Pagination implementation
3. When click author to sort, it should sort by the last name of the author
4. The raw data start with the author's first name followed by middle name and then last name. After formatting, the data could be sorted by the first author's last name in each tuple. The format of name was changed into APA style which starts with the author's last name followed by the initial of his middle name and first name.
